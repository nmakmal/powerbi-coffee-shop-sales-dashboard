# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Performance & Store Benchmarking Dashboard  
## üìå Project Overview  
Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** analyzing **149K+ transactions** from a coffee shop chain with **3 locations** over **6 months**.  
The dashboard provides **store benchmarking, revenue growth tracking, product performance insights, and customer behavior analysis** to support strategic decision-making.

## üéØ Business Objectives  
1. Benchmark store performance across revenue and average spend.  
2. Identify top-performing categories and products driving revenue.  
3. Analyze time-based sales patterns (day-of-week and hour-of-day).

## üóÇ Dataset  
- **Source:** This dataset was sourced from the [Maven Analytics Data Playground](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/coffee-shop-sales).  
- **Size:** 149,116 records, 11 fields  
- **Key Fields:**
  - `transaction_id` - Unique ID per transaction
  - `transaction_date` -  Date of the transaction
  - `transaction_time` - Timestamp of the transaction
  - `transaction_qty` - Quantity of items sold
  - `store_location` - Coffee shop location
  - `unit_price` - Retail price of the product sold
  - `product_category`,`product_type`,`product_detail` - Product attributes
- **Derived Metrics:**  
  - `revenue` = `transaction_qty` √ó `unit_price`  
  - Date/Time breakdowns: `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Processing

All data preparation was performed in **Power BI (Power Query)** before analysis and visualization.  

### 1. Data Quality Checks & Improvements  
- **Removed duplicates** from `transaction_id` ensure uniqueness of transactions.  
- Checked for missing/null values in key fields (`store_location`, `product_category`, `unit_price`).  
- Validated numeric fields: ensured `transaction_qty` and `unit_price` contained no negative or invalid values. 
- **Changed data types**:  
  - Ensured `transaction_date` was in **Date** format.  
  - Converted `transaction_time` into proper **Time** format.  

### 2. Standardization & Formatting  
- Applied **Trim()** & **Proper()** functions to clean and standardize text fields (`store_location`,`product_category`,`product_type`,`product_detail`) preventing mismatches.	

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Extracted date-based fields from `transaction_date`:  
  - `Month` ‚Üí for monthly revenue trends  
  - `Day Name` ‚Üí for weekday performance insights  
  - `MonthNo` ‚Üí for chronological sorting of months  
  - `DayNo` ‚Üí for chronological sorting of weekdays  
- Extracted **time field** from `transaction_time`:  
  - `Hour` ‚Üí for hourly sales analysis  
- Created **calculated column**:  
  - `revenue = transaction_qty √ó unit_price` ‚Üí revenue for each transaction
- Created **calculated measures** in DAX:  
  - `Total Revenue` ‚Üí core KPI used for store benchmarking and MoM growth tracking 
  - `Total Transactions`, `Total Units Sold`, `AvgTransactionValue` ‚Üí benchmark KPI for sales performance
  - `MoM %` ‚Üí compares current month revenue against the previous month using DATEADD for time intelligence  

### 4. Data Modeling in Power BI  
- Built a dedicated **Date Table** using DAX for accurate time intelligence.  
- Established relationships between the Date table and `transaction_date`.  
- Marked Date table as the official date dimension to enable Month-over-Month (MoM) calculations.

### ‚úÖ Result  
The dataset was fully cleaned and enriched within Power BI, producing a structured model ready for:  
- **Store benchmarking** (via standardized locations).  
- **Product analysis** (with clean categories and products).  
- **Time-based insights** (using Month, Day, and Hour fields).  
- **Revenue analysis** (using the calculated `Total Revenue` measures).

## üìä Dashboard Features  
- **KPI Cards:** Total Revenue ($698.8K), Total Transactions (149K), Total Units Sold (214K), Avg. Transaction Value ($4.69).  
- **Monthly Revenue Trend with MoM %:** Combo chart showing monthly revenue alongside Month-over-Month % growth, making business momentum visible at a glance.  
- **Revenue by Store:** Three stores contributed evenly (~$230K each).  
- **Revenue by Category:** Coffee (39%) and Tea (28%) dominate sales; smaller categories underperform.  
- **Revenue by Day of Week:** Weekdays consistently outperform weekends.  
- **Revenue by Hour of Day:** Morning hours (7‚Äì11 AM) capture peak sales activity.  
- **Top 5 Products by Revenue:** Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, Hot Chocolate, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Brewed Black Tea.  
- **Interactive Slicers:** Filters for Store Location and Month allow users to drill down into specific segments.

## üí° Key Insights  
- **Store Benchmarking:** All 3 stores generated similar revenue (~$230K each), though differences in **transaction volume vs. average spend** highlight opportunities for tailored strategies.  
- **Growth:** Sales doubled from **$82K in January ‚Üí $166K in June (+100%)**, with peak Month-over-Month growth of **+30% in May**.  
- **Top Category:** **Coffee (39%) and Tea (28%)** categories dominated sales, together contributing two-thirds of total revenue.  
- **Time-based patterns:** **Weekday mornings (7‚Äì11 AM)** drove peak demand, reflecting commuter-driven purchasing behavior.  
- **Top Product:** **Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, Hot Chocolate, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Brewed Black Tea** contributed disproportionately to revenue.
